100 Days of Code Stats and Data

#100 Days Of Code Data

## This project was inspired out of curiosity of the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
This tag was created by [@ka11away](https://twitter.com/ka11away) as a way to challenge others
to expand their knowledge in the world of code. For more information on this challenge you can
find that information [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4).

One of the rules of this challenge is to tweet about your progress everyday using the corresponding
hashtag. As I started to participate in this challenge I began to be curious on how many people
has started the challenge this year 2017, how many people were actually tweeting daily,
after how many days are the people starting no longer tweet about their progress, etc.

I created this cli to explore those questions.

## Installation

## Twitter Account
You must create a twitter account at [Twitter Apps] (https://apps.twitter.com/) for this to work.
Create a file named doNotCommit.rb under the config file directory.
This file will be used to save the consumer key which you will want to keep to yourself.

CONSUMER_KEY = *your consumer key here as a string*
CONSUMER_SECRET = *your consumer secret here as a string*

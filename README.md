#100 Days Of Code Data

## This project was inspired out of curiosity of the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
This tag was created by [@ka11away](https://twitter.com/ka11away) as a way to challenge others
to expand their knowledge in the world of code. For more information on this challenge you can
find that information [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4).

One of the rules of this challenge is to tweet about your progress everyday using the corresponding
hashtag. As I started to participate in this challenge I began to be curious on how many people
has started the challenge this year 2017, how many people were actually tweeting daily,
after how many days are the people starting no longer tweet about their progress, etc.

I created this cli to explore those questions.
